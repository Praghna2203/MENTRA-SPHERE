Mentra Sphere
Beyond Symptoms. Matching for Connection.

The Core Innovation
Traditional group therapy fails because of poor matching. Mentra Sphere replaces random assignment with Resonance-Based Clustering.

Zero-Touch Handoff: Auto-generates a Therapist Dossier (PDF) with group insights and icebreakers before the session starts.


Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python) for a seamless, calming UI.

Logic: Semantic Keyword & Sentiment Analysis (NLP).

Orchestration: Pandas-based Multi-Vector Clustering.

Reporting: FPDF for dynamic clinical document generation.
